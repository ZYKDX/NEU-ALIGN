use dictionary to accelerate
reason: a in b takes only O(1) for dictionary
idea:  suppose a and b are the pair 
    build a dict to store. for a in nums, store target-a as the key, and a's index as value
    then for later item b, if b in dict, then we get the pair a and b
    a's index is stored as the value of target-a, and b's index could be get through the loop variable
